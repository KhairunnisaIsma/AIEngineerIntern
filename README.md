# Image Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model for image classification using PyTorch. The model is trained on a custom dataset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Project Structure


- **`/data`**: This folder contains the training dataset. The dataset is organized into subdirectories where each subdirectory represents a class (label), and it contains images for that class.
- **`/models`**: Contains the code for the model architecture.
- **`/notebooks`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for training and testing the model.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
